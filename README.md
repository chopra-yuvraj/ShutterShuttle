# ShutterShuttle
ShutterShuttle is a hackathon project that uses face recognition to streamline campus shuttle payments. Students register once with a face photo, top up a digital wallet, and simply have their face scanned by drivers to automatically deduct fares eliminating queues and cash handling.
